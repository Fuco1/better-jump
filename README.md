# better-jump

`ace-jump-mode` done right.

Very alpha, do not use.

Currently provides these example jumps:

    bjump-word-jump (head-char)
    bjump-word-jump-line (head-char)
    bjump-word-jump-paragraph (head-char)
    bjump-window-jump ()
    bjump-help-link-jump ()
    bjump-info-link-jump ()
    bjump-dired-jump ()

These will probably get moved to an extra package or packages, and the core will be left as a "jumper framework"
