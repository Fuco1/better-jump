  "Execute action at a place.

An \"action\" is an arbitrary piece of elisp code that does
whatever.

A \"place\" or a \"candidate\" is a region inside a buffer upon
which an action is executed.  Note that an action can also just
ignore this information.

A \"jumper\" is a concrete instance of this function with
specified actions, places, scopes and so on.

This function is the main engine behind all the \"jumpers\".  It
is a higher-order function, taking other functions as arguments
which modify its behaviour.  You can think of it as a
\"skeleton\" with plug-able slots where you can put your own
custom code.

SELECTOR specifies the places at which it is possible to execute
an action.  It can be a character, a regular expression or a
function.

If a character, this is converted to a regular expression
matching beginnings of words that start with given character.

If a regular expression, this is used directly to match portions
of the buffer.

If a function, it should take two arguments: beginning and end
positions inside which we search for the places.  It can return
either a list of overlays, where each overlay spans one place, or
a list of cons pairs (beg . end), where each specifies one place.

WINDOW-SCOPE is a function taking zero arguments and returning a
cons pair (beg . end).  This \"region\" is passed to the
selector.

Window scope resolution is useful to narrow down the region of
the visible portion of the window from where candidates should be
picked.  It should return bounds of this region.  These bounds
should not overflow the visible buffer region.

FRAME-SCOPE is a function taking zero arguments and returning a
list of (visible) windows where we should look for candidates.

Note especially that you have to return a list even if you only
want one window (cf. `bjump-fs-current-window').  The windows are
then selected in order of the returned list, so if you want some
special ordering, order them before returning the list.

PICKER is a procedure which picks the place.  It can be an
interactive function but does not need to.  It takes one
argument, the list of overlays representing all possible places.

ACTION is a function taking the overlay representing the place
and producing whatever result, doing anything whatsoever.  At the
time this function is executed, selected window is the window
from where the jump function was called.  You can get the
\"target\" window where the passed overlay was defined by reading
the property `:bjump-window' from the overlay.

The following hooks should be symbols pointing to lists such that
they can be passed into `run-hooks'.

BEFORE-ACTION-HOOK is a hook variable executed before action.

AFTER-ACTION-HOOK is a hook variable executed after action.

AFTER-CLEANUP-HOOK is a hook variable executed just before this
function returns."
